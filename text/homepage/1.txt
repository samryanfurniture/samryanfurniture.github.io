Furniture restoration of modern and antique furniture

Each piece of furniture restored is finished to the specification of the clients needs, whether it needs to be fixed from having broken parts that need to be replaced, has loose joints that need to be fixed or glued back together, or if it needs to be stripped and re-polished with normal or French polish.
