Furniture Design and Make

Sam Ryan designs and makes hand crafted furniture which is both attractive as well as functional through their individual simplistic design characteristics, which are formed through the making and construction of the piece.  Working with the vision and customisation of the client's specification, Sam strives to fulfil the purpose of their piece of furniture and to bring pleasure to the client.

Sam Ryan's design process is aimed at simplicity, which is focused on attention to detail, to enhance the beauty of the wood through the use of subtle elegant soft lines and the use of hand made joints, to create greater strength and a visual attraction to show its quality and appearance. The construction is made to best suit the design and function, whether the joints are exposed or hidden in its construction.
